#### Perceptrons
A perceptron takes several binary inputs, x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, …, and produces a single binary output. 
With the concept of weights, w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, …, expressing the importance of the respective inputs. The output is 0 or 1, determined by the dot product of the input vector and the weight vector. Output equals 1 if the w dot x + b is greater than 0, b is the bias. **Perceptron is a method for weighting evidence to make decisions.**
