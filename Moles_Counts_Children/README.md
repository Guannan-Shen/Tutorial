A simple final project of 6611, to explore the moles counts on Colorado children and life style.
## Data is not for public. ##
#### The workflow ####
1. Import the .xls mole count of children from 2004 to 2008 data 
2. From the backgroud literature review and went through the variables, come up with the question that lm(mole count ~ waterside vacaion + oca2gene_status/ + baseskin_color)
3. Summary the informtion of the data, tidydata.
4. Do the linear regression diagnostic quick in sas and find the proper set of mole count ~ waterside vacation (data in longitudinal form, just choose one time point to do simple linear regression)
5. Make a decision what the model is, whether to include other variables such as oca2gene, gender, base skin color, hair color, eyecolor.
6. Make table 1 with xtable
7. Make the linear regression plot
8. Do the bootstrap estimate of beta coefficient, the slope
9. The 3-page report
